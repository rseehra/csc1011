The average cost per click on google is just under a dollar when compared to Facebook advertising which is 25 cents per click. The target market for these toys would be pre-teens as well as those who play the role-playing game associated with the toys. I would go the route of Facebooks and google ads because the target market could be targeted more effectively with the knowledge that the target market being pre-teens who spend a lot of time on social media this could be an effective way to reach them. These marketing types would take up about half of my monthly budget. The way I would do the advertising is having the toys in a good vs. evil theme. The keywords I would focus on would be “Galaxy”, “Role-Playing”, “Toys”, “Good”, and “Evil”. The rest of the monthly budget I would call the role playing game and try and set up a marketing plan where they can make money by specific sales brought from the games webpage itself, as well as promotions to offer players codes that would accompany the toy that they would purchase to recieve in game items or bonuses.
