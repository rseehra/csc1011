Some design flaws that I noticed on the webpage was the clutter of buttons on the right hand side, lack of design, purpose of website is unknown, and a mystery picture that is not beneficial to the page at all. The buttons have titles like lisp, arc, yc, and H&P, it is hard to understand where these buttons will lead to or the information they represent. The webpages purpose is cryptic without a title. The webpage could also use descriptions followed by buttons to help decipher the page. The page could also use a better layout to be able to navigate it in a more efficient way. The website could use tabs at the top to navigate through the website and separate the links to other pages that could use descriptions.
